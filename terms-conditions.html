                  <li>
                    This agreement constitutes a complete and comprehensive electronic contract, including its terms,
                    provisions, and privacy policy, which encompasses all rights and obligations. Furthermore, it
                    constitutes a final agreement between the platform on the one hand and other users, including
                    service providers, customers, and other visitors, on the other hand. Each user acknowledges that
                    they have not relied on any previous documents, confirmations, or information other than those
                    specified in this agreement. This agreement supersedes any previous agreements between the platform
                    and any of its users.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This agreement does not negate any agreements, correspondences, notices, or notifications, or any
                    other agreements in which the platform is a party and confirms as an agreement. These agreements
                    complement the provisions of this agreement. In case of a conflict between any of the provisions of
                    these agreements and the terms and provisions of this agreement, the former shall apply in full if
                    they are subsequent to this agreement or its latest updates, considering them a special agreement
                    between the platform on the one hand and the user on the other. Any individual correspondences that
                    the user sends to the platform without the latter's confirmation as an agreement are not within the
                    scope of the agreements.
                  </li>
                  <li>This agreement is a legal contract that cannot be challenged or denied or cancelled by any of the

                    the date of their explicit or implicit acceptance by continuing to use the platform.

                  <li>
                    This agreement is subject to continuous modification and updating. Therefore, it is within the
                    platform's rights to add any additional terms and provisions to this agreement, or to change,
                    modify, or update any of the existing terms and provisions. The user shall be bound by these new
                    terms from the date of their approval.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All private agreements between the service provider and the customer that are not subject to the
                    provisions of this agreement are outside the scope of this agreement. These relationships are
                    governed by the agreed-upon terms between the parties within the final agreement upon request,
                    without any direct intervention from the platform.

                    Fidelen website is an online platform specialized in displaying services and products needed by
                    commercial entities that are allowed through the platform provided by service providers according to
                    the platform's work mechanisms.



                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To request services, the customer browses what is displayed on the platform and communicates with
                    service providers or through the competition system via the platform. The customer fills out the
                    request information through the platform to benefit from the service or communicates with the
                    service provider inside the platform and discusses their request.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The platform allows service providers to submit their offers to the customer after receiving a
                    direct quote request or through competitions via the platform. They can also communicate with the
                    customer and send general inquiries and files to the customer.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When the initial agreement is reached between the parties, the platform provides a uniform model for
                    a final agreement that includes details of the service or product, quantities, delivery dates, order
                    preparation stages, payment percentages based on progress, amount, terms, and conditions between the
                    parties, and is considered a legal document that guarantees the rights of both parties.

                    One of the most important advantages of the platform is providing the service of deferred payment
                    through a third-party funder, which reduces the vendor's risk of payment default and provides cash
                    liquidity to the customer, with payment after 30, 60, or 90 days and a percentage of the order value
                    collected from the customer after the platform and the funding party approve the transaction
                    according to the customer's credit record.

                  <li>
                    The platform collects the full value of the order in advance from the customer and pays the vendor
                    upon the customer's confirmation of completing each stage until the complete order is finished.

                  </li>
                  <li>

                    The platform provides its services to the customer for free, and the service provider subscribes
                    annually or monthly according to what is determined by the platform management.

                    The client assumes full responsibility in case of making direct payments to the service provider
                    outside the platform, as it will appear that the final agreement is pending due to non-payment.
                    Any amounts or fees paid by the user outside the platform's applicable system are not considered,
                    and the user will be obligated to pay for orders as a debt until the platform receives them.

                  On the Fidelen platform, we provide the option of deferred payment through a third-party funder and

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We allow you to add reviews and ratings through the Fidelen platform. These reviews and ratings must
                    be objective and should not be intended to harm any party, person, or user of the Fidelen platform.
                    They should not include any harm to any other entity or person.

                  <li>
                    Reviews and ratings should not include any advertisements or promotions for services, products,
                    websites, applications, pages, entities, or individuals. They should not include any external links
                    or
                    software of any kind.

                  <li>
                    The platform reserves the right to reject the publication of reviews and ratings provided through
                    the
                    platform if we deem them to be subjective or arbitrary, violate any of our terms, or may result in
                    any
                    current or future legal issues.


                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the event that any person is harmed due to reviews and ratings submitted through the Fidelen
                    platform, they have the right to resort to legal action and file legal claims and compensation
                    without
                    any legal, solidarity, or dependent responsibility on the Fidelen platform.
